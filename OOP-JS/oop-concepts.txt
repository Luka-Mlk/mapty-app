1. Abstraction is hiding what the user doesnt need
  (all details of phone)

2. Encapsulation keeps properties and methods of classes private
  (prevents external code from manipulating private params)

3. Inheritance (instance of object thats has more privileges)
  (an admin is essentialy an inherited user with more privileges)

4. Polymorphism a child class cn overwrite a method inherited from a parent class
  (an admin would need 2 factor auth, we just overwrite the login from the user)
